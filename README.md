##Tools


The loc_formatter.pl script takes a loc file that is formatted to 80 char lines and converts it to single line data (i.e joinmap output data)

```
./loc_formatter.pl your_loc_file.loc
```

The gap_inserter.pl script takes as its input a concatenated loc file which can be produced using the following commands assuming that you are using affy data:

```
for f in *.loc; do tail +7 $f |  tail -r | tail +183 |tail -r ; done >merged.locus
perl -ne '/AX/ && print' merged.locus | wc -l
./gap_inserter.pl merged.loc em_fe_numbers.txt 
```

Note that at present there is hard coded stuff in this script, which contains the header information required to produce a joinmap compatible file.
The map_reader.pl script takes your map, a probe set mapping (needed for collapsed markers) and the map to compare with and outputs the comparison

```
./map_reader.pl combined_map.txt groups.txt hxk_map.csv
```

The map_sorter.pl tool will take a disordered map and sort it into ascending cM order for each linkage group. This is necessary if the map_reader.pl tool has been used.

```
./map_sorter.pl map_to_sort.map  map_sorted.map 
```

The map_formatter.pl script takes a non-standard map file, such as those generated by map_reader.pl and convers is into joinmap format:

```
./map_formatter.pl maptoformat.txt name_of_map_to_output.map
```

The map_reducer script will reduce the map from joinmap to the groups that you want
```
./map_reducer.pl original_map.txt desired_map_groups.txt >map_filtered.map
```





##Run through with Emily x Fenella population

Map reader compares the maps and outputs matching loci
```
./map_reader.pl ./em_fe/combined_map.txt ./files/groups.txt ./hoxko/hxk_map.txt
```

Combine Emily and Fenella loc Files

```
cd ./em_fe
for f in *.loc; do tail  -n +7 $f | head -n -183; done >../merged.locus
perl -ne '/AX/ && print' merged.locus | wc -l
```

Format the loc file to remove 80 char issue
```
./loc_formatter.pl ./em_fe/merged.locus ./em_fe/formatted.loc
```

Insert the gaps, based on the missing data
```
./gap_inserter.pl ./em_fe/formatted.loc ./em_fe/em_fe_numbers.txt ./em_fe/output_new.loc
```

Sort the map by cM position
```
./map_sorter.pl ./em_fe/exf_processed.map  ./em_fe/exf_sorted.map 
```

Format the map in joinmap format
```
./map_formatter.pl ./em_fe/exf_sorted.map ./em_fe/exf_joinmap
```



##Run through with Redgauntlet x Hapil population


###Map Reduction
Reduce the map from joinmap to the groups that you want, in this case the combined map.
```
./map_reducer.pl ./rgxha/combined_map.txt ./rgxha/combined_map_groups.txt >./rgxha/combined_map_filtered.map
```

###Map Comparison
Map reader compares the maps and outputs matching loci
```
./map_reader.pl ./rgxha/combined_map_filtered.map ./files/groups.txt ./hoxko/hxk_map.csv >./rgxha/pairwise_map.txt
```

Sort the map by cM position 
```
./map_sorter.pl ./rg_ha/rxh_processed.map  ./rg_ha/rxh_sorted.map 
```

###Map formatting 

Format the map in joinmap format
```
./map_formatter.pl ./rg_ha/rxh_sorted.map ./rg_ha/rxh_joinmap.map
```
Rename the map groups so that they are unified with HxK, note you have to manually enter the number of linkage groups and the number of markers
```
 ./map_namer.pl ./rgxha/combined_map_filtered.map ./rgxha/map_compare.txt ./rgxha/rgxha_renamed.map 28 3933
```

### Loc file formatting

Combine Redgauntlet and Hapil loc Files
```
cd ./rg_ha
for f in *.loc; do tail  -n +7 $f | head -n -142; done >../merged.locus
perl -ne '/AX/ && print' merged.locus | wc -l
```

Format the loc file to remove 80 char issue
```
./loc_formatter.pl ./rgxha/merged.locus ./rgxha/formatted.loc
```

Insert the gaps, based on the missing data
```
./gap_inserter.pl ./rgxha/formatted.loc ./rgxha/rgxha_numbers.txt ./rgxha/output.loc
```
